    <h1>Common Trading Mistakes Guide</h1>
    
    <div class="tip">
        <strong>Success Rate:</strong> Studies show that 90% of traders fail within the first year. The good news? Most failures come from repeatable, avoidable mistakes. Learn from others' errors instead of your own capital.
    </div>

    <h2>1. Psychological Mistakes</h2>
    
    <div class="mistake-box">
        <h4>Mistake #1: Overtrading</h4>
        <p><strong>Description:</strong> Taking too many trades, often out of boredom or the need for action.</p>
        <p><strong>Why It Happens:</strong> Fear of missing out (FOMO), addiction to the excitement, need to "make back" losses quickly.</p>
        <p><strong>Impact:</strong> Higher commission costs, emotional exhaustion, poor decision-making, and death by a thousand cuts.</p>
        
        <div class="solution-box">
            <h5>Solution:</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>Set a maximum number of trades per day/week (e.g., 3-5 trades)</li>
                <li>Only trade your highest-confidence setups (A+ setups only)</li>
                <li>Create strict entry criteria and follow them religiously</li>
                <li>Remember: Quality over quantity - one good trade beats ten mediocre ones</li>
                <li>Walk away from charts after your limit is reached</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="mistake-box">
        <h4>Mistake #2: Revenge Trading</h4>
        <p><strong>Description:</strong> Immediately entering a new trade after a loss to "make the money back."</p>
        <p><strong>Why It Happens:</strong> Ego, anger, denial that you were wrong, emotional rather than logical decision-making.</p>
        <p><strong>Impact:</strong> Often leads to even bigger losses, spiraling into account destruction.</p>
        
        <div class="solution-box">
            <h5>Solution:</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>Implement a mandatory 30-minute break after any losing trade</li>
                <li>Set hard daily loss limits (e.g., 3% of account) and STOP when hit</li>
                <li>Accept that losses are part of trading - they don't define you</li>
                <li>Journal your emotions after losses to recognize patterns</li>
                <li>Remember: The market will be here tomorrow - your capital won't if you blow it up</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="mistake-box">
        <h4>Mistake #3: Moving Stop Losses</h4>
        <p><strong>Description:</strong> Adjusting your stop loss further away when price approaches it, hoping it will reverse.</p>
        <p><strong>Why It Happens:</strong> Not wanting to accept the loss, convincing yourself "it will come back."</p>
        <p><strong>Impact:</strong> Turns small, manageable losses into account-destroying disasters.</p>
        
        <div class="solution-box">
            <h5>Solution:</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>Set your stop loss BEFORE entering and commit to it</li>
                <li>Only move stops in your favor (to protect profit), never against you</li>
                <li>Use a stop loss order, not a mental stop (removes temptation)</li>
                <li>Accept that when price hits your stop, your analysis was wrong</li>
                <li>Rule: The only direction to move a stop loss is TIGHTER, never WIDER</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
    </div>

    <h2>2. Technical Mistakes</h2>
    
    <div class="mistake-box">
        <h4>Mistake #4: Trading Without a Plan</h4>
        <p><strong>Description:</strong> Entering trades impulsively without defined entry, exit, and risk parameters.</p>
        <p><strong>Why It Happens:</strong> FOMO, excitement, believing you can "figure it out" as the trade develops.</p>
        <p><strong>Impact:</strong> Inconsistent results, inability to learn from mistakes, emotional decision-making.</p>
        
        <div class="solution-box">
            <h5>Solution:</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>Create a written trading plan that defines your strategy</li>
                <li>Before every trade, know: Entry, Stop Loss, Take Profit, Position Size</li>
                <li>Use a checklist - if all criteria aren't met, don't trade</li>
                <li>Document every trade: setup, reasoning, outcome</li>
                <li>"Failing to plan is planning to fail" - always have a plan</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="mistake-box">
        <h4>Mistake #5: Ignoring Risk Management</h4>
        <p><strong>Description:</strong> Risking too much per trade or not calculating position size.</p>
        <p><strong>Why It Happens:</strong> Greed, overconfidence, not understanding compounding losses.</p>
        <p><strong>Impact:</strong> Even a few bad trades can destroy months of profits or your entire account.</p>
        
        <div class="solution-box">
            <h5>Solution:</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>Never risk more than 1-2% of your account on a single trade</li>
                <li>Calculate position size based on your stop loss distance</li>
                <li>Use the formula: Position Size = (Account × Risk%) / Stop Distance</li>
                <li>Keep total portfolio risk under 6-10% maximum</li>
                <li>Remember: You can't trade if you blow up your account</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="mistake-box">
        <h4>Mistake #6: Overleveraging</h4>
        <p><strong>Description:</strong> Using excessive leverage (e.g., 50:1, 100:1) to control large positions.</p>
        <p><strong>Why It Happens:</strong> Desire for bigger profits, not understanding leverage magnifies losses equally.</p>
        <p><strong>Impact:</strong> Small market moves can wipe out your account through margin calls.</p>
        
        <div class="solution-box">
            <h5>Solution:</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>Use conservative leverage: 5:1 to 10:1 maximum for beginners</li>
                <li>Leverage amplifies BOTH gains and losses - respect it</li>
                <li>Calculate your effective leverage: (Total Position Value) / (Account Balance)</li>
                <li>Most professionals use less leverage, not more</li>
                <li>High leverage + one bad trade = game over</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
    </div>

    <h2>3. Strategy Mistakes</h2>
    
    <div class="mistake-box">
        <h4>Mistake #7: Chasing Trends</h4>
        <p><strong>Description:</strong> Entering trades after big moves have already occurred ("buying the top, selling the bottom").</p>
        <p><strong>Why It Happens:</strong> FOMO, seeing big gains others made, emotional reaction to strong moves.</p>
        <p><strong>Impact:</strong> Buying at highs leads to immediate drawdowns and losses.</p>
        
        <div class="solution-box">
            <h5>Solution:</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>Wait for pullbacks in trends - never chase extended moves</li>
                <li>Use the "patience pays" rule: miss the first 20% of a move, catch the middle 60%</li>
                <li>Set alerts for key levels and wait for price to come to you</li>
                <li>If you missed the move, there will ALWAYS be another one</li>
                <li>Better to miss a trade than to enter at the worst possible price</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="mistake-box">
        <h4>Mistake #8: Trading Against the Trend</h4>
        <p><strong>Description:</strong> Trying to pick tops and bottoms by trading counter to the dominant trend.</p>
        <p><strong>Why It Happens:</strong> Belief you're smarter than the market, seeing "obvious" reversals.</p>
        <p><strong>Impact:</strong> Low win rate, getting steamrolled by continuation moves, constant stops hit.</p>
        
        <div class="solution-box">
            <h5>Solution:</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>"The trend is your friend" - trade WITH the major trend, not against it</li>
                <li>On daily charts, if trend is up, only look for buy setups</li>
                <li>If you must trade reversals, wait for strong confirmation (multiple signals)</li>
                <li>Use smaller position sizes on counter-trend trades</li>
                <li>Remember: The market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="mistake-box">
        <h4>Mistake #9: Not Using Stop Losses</h4>
        <p><strong>Description:</strong> Trading without stop losses, hoping losing positions will reverse.</p>
        <p><strong>Why It Happens:</strong> "It always comes back," fear of getting stopped out, laziness.</p>
        <p><strong>Impact:</strong> Small losses become catastrophic losses, single trades can destroy accounts.</p>
        
        <div class="solution-box">
            <h5>Solution:</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>ALWAYS use stop losses - no exceptions, ever</li>
                <li>Place stop loss orders immediately when entering trade</li>
                <li>Set stops at logical levels (below support, above resistance)</li>
                <li>Your stop loss is your maximum acceptable loss - honor it</li>
                <li>If you can't accept the stop loss, don't take the trade</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
    </div>

    <h2>4. Mindset Mistakes</h2>
    
    <div class="mistake-box">
        <h4>Mistake #10: Expecting to Get Rich Quick</h4>
        <p><strong>Description:</strong> Believing trading will make you wealthy overnight or in weeks/months.</p>
        <p><strong>Why It Happens:</strong> Social media hype, scam course promises, not understanding realistic returns.</p>
        <p><strong>Impact:</strong> Excessive risk-taking, disappointment, giving up too early.</p>
        
        <div class="solution-box">
            <h5>Solution:</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>Realistic annual returns for professionals: 15-30%</li>
                <li>Growing a $10k account to $1M takes YEARS of consistent performance</li>
                <li>Focus on monthly consistency (2-5% per month is excellent)</li>
                <li>Compare yourself to index funds (8-10% yearly) - beating that is success</li>
                <li>Trading is a marathon, not a sprint - patience compounds</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="mistake-box">
        <h4>Mistake #11: Not Keeping a Trading Journal</h4>
        <p><strong>Description:</strong> Failing to document trades, leading to inability to learn from mistakes.</p>
        <p><strong>Why It Happens:</strong> Laziness, thinking you'll remember, not seeing immediate value.</p>
        <p><strong>Impact:</strong> Repeating same mistakes, no data to identify weaknesses, slow improvement.</p>
        
        <div class="solution-box">
            <h5>Solution:</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>Document EVERY trade: entry, exit, reasoning, emotions, outcome</li>
                <li>Include screenshots of your charts</li>
                <li>Review journal weekly to identify patterns</li>
                <li>Track statistics: win rate, avg R:R, profit factor, drawdowns</li>
                <li>Your journal is your roadmap to improvement - take it seriously</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="mistake-box">
        <h4>Mistake #12: Comparing to Others</h4>
        <p><strong>Description:</strong> Measuring success against social media traders or peers.</p>
        <p><strong>Why It Happens:</strong> Social media highlight reels, competitive nature, insecurity.</p>
        <p><strong>Impact:</strong> Unnecessary risk-taking, frustration, deviation from your plan.</p>
        
        <div class="solution-box">
            <h5>Solution:</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>Your only competition is your past self</li>
                <li>Unfollow traders who make you feel inadequate or tempt you to overtrade</li>
                <li>Most "big winner" posts don't show the full picture or losses</li>
                <li>Focus on YOUR improvement, YOUR consistency, YOUR plan</li>
                <li>Success is beating the market average, not being the best trader in the world</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
    </div>
