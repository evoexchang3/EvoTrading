## 🔑 1. JWT Secrets & Session Security

### **Current Issue**

* The `JWT_ACCESS_SECRET` and `JWT_REFRESH_SECRET` are **re-generated on every restart**, which invalidates all existing sessions and tokens.

### **Required Fix**

* Use **persistent secrets** for JWT authentication in production.
* Configure environment variables:

  * `JWT_ACCESS_SECRET`
  * `JWT_REFRESH_SECRET`
* Store both securely in **Replit Secrets**.
  *(I already have the production values ready and can provide them when the environment variables are in place.)*
