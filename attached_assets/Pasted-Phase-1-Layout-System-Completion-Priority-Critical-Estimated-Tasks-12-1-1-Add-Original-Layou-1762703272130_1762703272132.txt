1.1 Add "Original" Layout Option
* Add "original" to layoutVariants array in AdminConfigPage.tsx
* Create variantConfig entry for "original" layout (representing current default design)
* Set as first option in variant selector

1.3 Select 3 Minimalistic Layouts
Chosen layouts for minimal feature set:
* arctic-minimal - Already designed for minimalism (Scandinavian-inspired)

These 3 will have:
* Simplified navigation (minimal-text or compact-top only)
* Minimalist footer (minimalist-line or legal-micro only)
* Fewer dashboard widgets
